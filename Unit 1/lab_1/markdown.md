Markdown is a maca language that makes it easy to apply formatting to text employing a series of features of a special format, it was developed by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber)  with the help of [Aaron Swartz](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz)  in 2004 in order to
that people could write using a text format
plain easy to read, easy to write and with the possibility of converting your
valid HTML document.


## Basic Syntax

| Element  | Syntaxs |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  Heading    | #
| Bold     | **text**     |
| Italic     | *text*     |
|Blockcuote| >text |
|Ordered List  | 1. Text  2. Text|
| Undered list | - First Text -Second text|

if (true) foo = `foo´
```

file opened with a plain text editor


## Difference between Markdown and HTML
HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Additionally, Markdown's formatting syntax only targets issues that can be expressed in plain text. For those markups that are not covered by Markdown syntax, simply use the HTML itself.
